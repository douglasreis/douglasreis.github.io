  Hi, my name's Doug and I'm a passionate Senior Full Stack Software Developer üöÄ having an experience of building multiple applications with .Net / Node.js / JavaScript / Python. Lately I have been involved in several projects in AWS and other tools such as CI/CD to enable other developers to deliver their products in a efficient and reliable manner. Those projects have instigated in me more interest to learn even more about cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è development and infrastructure as code.
  
  I have worked in a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills and in this path I've learnt a lot how to offer support to other people in their career development. This part of my job has been very gratifying in my journey. üôå

  I am most skilled in: <mark>.Net</mark> and <mark>AWS services</mark>
