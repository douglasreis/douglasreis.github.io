  Hi, my name's Doug and I'm a passionate Senior Full Stack Software Developer üöÄ having an experience of building multiple applications with .Net / Node.js / JavaScript / Python. Lately I have been involved in several projects in AWS and other tools such as CI/CD to enable other developers to deliver their products in a efficient and reliable manner. Those projects have instigated in me more interest to learn even more about cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è development and infrastructure as code.
  
  I have worked in a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills and in this path I've learnt a lot how to offer support to other people in their career development. This part of my job has been very gratifying in my journey. üôå

  I am most skilled in: <mark>.Net</mark> and <mark>AWS services</mark>

          Finding the right job or the right candidate is not one of the easiest tasks. Developing tools and intelligence behind the hiring and jobseeking process has been my life in Totaljobs Group for a few years already. I have circulated in various projects and worked with very interesting people in the business. I have been helping in forming teams and developing people during my time in the company. The company also gives me a lot of space for experimentation and learning new technologies.
