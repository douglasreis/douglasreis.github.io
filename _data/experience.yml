    Finding the right job or the right candidate is not one of the easiest tasks. Developing tools and intelligence behind the hiring and jobseeking process has been my life in Totaljobs Group for a few years already. I have circulated in various projects and worked with very interesting people in the business. I have been helping in forming teams and developing people during my time in the company. The company also gives me a lot of space for experimentation and learning new technologies.
